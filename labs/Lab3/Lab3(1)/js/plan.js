//setup canvas and background

//Set x equal to 16. Add 32 
//If x is less than the width of the canvas, 
    //then create a circle. 
    //Loop this until x is greater than the width of the canvas

    //if x is divisible by 3 with 0 remainders
        //then fill the circle with purple

    //if x is divisible 5 with 0 remainders
        //then draw a square and fill it with green 

    //if x is divisible by 3 with 0 remainders AND if x is divisible by 5 with 0 remainders
        //then draw a square and fill it with blue
